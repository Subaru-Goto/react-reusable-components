# react-reusable-components

This is an example of reusable react component.

Using "children" property of props, we can use react components like the way we write HTML (<COMPONENT> children comes here </COMPONENT>).
In this way, we have more flexibility (for example, we can pass <a> anchor tag so on) and have a cleaner code.
